# Lab 01

Hello, this is the finished first lab. I hope you enjoy it! I tried to make a personal website that I plan to show to employers, (After making some future changes) so I put only information about myself. I tried to add a bunch of dynamic elements like the snow fall or menu that links to different parts of the page. Also using css to make items dynamic when hovering over them. I am the most proud of the snow though, if you hit the "let it snow!!" button in the page it generates particles. The more you hit it the more it generates. Also I recently added a function that tracks the mouse location, so the user can interact with the snow.

## Remarks

To the TA reading this, if there are any problems with my zip folder, the github pages works. Also my github account has the Lab-1 repository.
